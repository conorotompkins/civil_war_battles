On April 30, Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford ForrestÂ’s brigade caught
up with StreightÂ’s expedition and attacked its rearguard at DayÂ’s Gap on
Sand Mountain. The Federals repulsed this attack and continued their march
to avoid further delay and envelopment. Thus began a running series of
skirmishes and engagements at Crooked Creek (April 30), Hog Mountain (April
30), Blountsville (May 1), Black Creek/Gadsden (May 2), and BlountÂ’s Plantation (May 2). Forrest finally surrounded the exhausted Union soldiers near Rome, Georgia, where he forced their surrender on May 3.

Sherman first found Johnston's army entrenched in the Marietta area on June 9.  The Confederate's had established defensive lines along Brushy, Pine, and Lost Mountains.  Sherman extended his forces beyond the Confederate lines, causing a partial Rebel withdrawal to another line of positions. After further pressure and skirmishing from Union forces, Johnston withdrew to an arc-shaped position centered on Kennesaw Mountain on June 18 and 19. Sherman made some unsuccessful attacks on this position but eventually extended the line on his right and forced Johnston to withdrawal from the Marietta area on July 2-3.

","  Johnston’s army fell back from the vicinity of Cassville-Kinston,
first to Allatoona Pass and then to the Dallas area and entrenched. ShermanÂ’s
army tested the Rebel line while entrenching themselves. The Battle of
Dallas occurred on May 28 when Lt. Gen. William J. HardeeÂ’s corps probed
the Union defensive line, held by Maj. Gen. John A. LoganÂ’s Army of the
Tennessee corps, to exploit any weakness or possible withdrawal. Fighting
ensued at two different points, but the Rebels were repulsed, suffering
high casualties. Sherman continued looking for a way around JohnstonÂ’s
line, and, on June 1, his cavalry occupied Allatoona Pass, which had a
railroad and would allow his men and supplies to reach him by train. Sherman
abandoned his lines at Dallas on June 5 and moved toward the railhead at
Allatoona Pass forcing Johnston to follow soon afterwards.

"," From Vicksburg, Mississippi, Sherman launched a campaign
to take the important railroad center at Meridian and, if the situation
was favorable, to push on to Selma and threaten Mobile, in order to prevent
the shipment of Confederate men and supplies. To counter the threat, Confederate
President Jefferson Davis ordered troops into the area. While these operations
unfolded, Thomas determined to probe Gen. Johnston’s army in the hope that
JohnstonÂ’s loss of two divisions, sent to reinforce Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk
as he withdrew from Meridian to Demopolis, Alabama, would make him vulnerable.
Skirmishing and intense fighting occurred throughout the demonstration.
At Crow Valley on the 25th, Union troops almost turned the Rebel right
flank, but ultimately it held. On the 27th, ThomasÂ’s army withdrew, realizing
that Johnston was ready and able to counter any assault.

","   After the Tullahoma Campaign, Rosecrans renewed his offensive,
aiming to force the Rebels out of Chattanooga. The three corps comprising
RosecransÂ’s army split and set out for Chattanooga by separate routes.
Hearing of the Union advance, Braxton Bragg concentrated troops around
Chattanooga. While Col. John T. WilderÂ’s artillery fired on Chattanooga,
Rosecrans attempted to take advantage of BraggÂ’s situation and ordered
other troops into Georgia. They raced forward, seized the important gaps,
and moved out into McLemoreÂ’s Cove. NegleyÂ’s XIV Army Corps division, supported
by Brig. Gen. Absalom BairdÂ’s division, was moving across the mouth of
the cove on the Dug Gap road when Negley learned that Rebels were concentrating
around Dug Gap. Moving through determined resistance, he closed on the
gap, withdrawing to DavisÂ’ Cross Roads in the evening of September 10 to
await the supporting division. Bragg had ordered General Hindman with his
division to assault Negley at DavisÂ’ Cross Roads in the flank, while Maj.
Gen. Patrick R. CleburneÂ’s division forced its way through Dug Gap to strike
Negley in front. Hindman was to receive reinforcements for this movement,
but most of them did not arrive. The Rebel officers, therefore, met and
decided that they could not attack in their present condition. The next
morning, however, fresh troops did arrive, and the Rebels began to move
on the Union line. The supporting Union division had, by now, joined Negley,
and, hearing of a Confederate attack, the Union forces determined that
a strategic withdrawal to Stevens Gap was in order. Negley first moved
his division to the ridge east of West Chickamauga Creek where it established
a defensive line. The other division then moved through them to Stevens
Gap and established a defensive line there. Both divisions awaited the
rest of Maj. Gen. George ThomasÂ’s corps. All of this was accomplished under
constant pursuit and fire from the Confederates.

He ordered the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. O.O. Howard,
to move from the left wing to the right and cut HoodÂ’s last railroad supply
line between East Point and Atlanta. Hood foresaw such a maneuver and determined
to send the two corps of Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee and Lt. Gen. Alexander
P. Stewart to intercept and destroy the Union force. Thus, on the afternoon
of July 28, the Rebels assaulted Howard at Ezra Church. Howard had anticipated
such a thrust, entrenched one of his corps in the ConfederatesÂ’ path, and
repulsed the determined attack, inflicting numerous casualties. Howard,
however, failed to cut the railroad.

Quincy A. Gillmore, an engineer officer, to take charge of the investment
force and begin the bombardment and capture of the fort. Gillmore emplaced
artillery on the mainland southeast of the fort and began the bombardment
on April 10 after Colonel Charles H. Olmstead refused to surrender the
fort. Within hours, GillmoreÂ’s rifled artillery had breached the southeast
scarp of the fort, and he continued to exploit it. Some of his shells began

Rebels would have to evacuate Atlanta. Sherman, therefore, decided to move
six of his seven infantry corps against the supply lines. The army began
pulling out of its positions on August 25 to hit the Macon & Western
Railroad between Rough and Ready and Jonesborough. To counter the move,
Hood sent Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee with two corps to halt and possibly
rout the Union troops, not realizing ShermanÂ’s army was there in force.
On August 31, Hardee attacked two Union corps west of Jonesborough but
was easily repulsed. Fearing an attack on Atlanta, Hood withdrew one corps
from HardeeÂ’s force that night. The next day, a Union corps broke through
HardeeÂ’ s troops which retreated to LovejoyÂ’s Station, and on the night
of September 1, Hood evacuated Atlanta. Sherman did cut HoodÂ’s supply line

29, ConnorÂ’s troops appeared across the river and began crossing. Before

all of the men had crossed and Connor had arrived, some troops made an

unsuccessful frontal attack which the Indians easily repulsed inflicting

numerous casualties. When Connor took over, he sent troops to where the

ravine debouched through the bluffs. Some of these men covered the mouth

of the ravine to prevent any escape while others moved down the rims, firing

on the Indians below. This fire killed many of the warriors, but some attempted

to escape by swimming the icy river where other troops shot them. The battle

He compelled the Confederates to abandon Paintsville and retreat to the

cavalry and turned west to attack Marshall. Marshall had put his men in

fortified the area, especially both sides of the Cumberland River. Union

first skirmished with Rebel cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the

fighting became more general, on Peters Hill, as the grayclad infantry

arrived. The next day, at dawn, fighting began again around Peters Hill

as a Union division advanced up the pike, halting just before the Confederate

line. The fighting then stopped for a time. After noon, a Confederate division

struck the Union left flank and forced it to fall back. When more Confederate

divisions joined the fray, the Union line made a stubborn stand, counterattacked,

but finally fell back with some troops routed. Buell did not know of the

happenings on the field, or he would have sent forward some reserves. Even

so, the Union troops on the left flank, reinforced by two brigades, stabilized

their line, and the Rebel attack sputtered to a halt. Later, a Rebel brigade

assaulted the Union division on the Springfield Pike but was repulsed and

fell back into Perryville. The Yankees pursued, and skirmishing occurred

in the streets in the evening before dark. Union reinforcements were threatening

the Rebel left flank by now. Bragg, short of men and supplies, withdrew

during the night, and, after pausing at Harrodsburg, continued the Confederate

retrograde by way of Cumberland Gap into East Tennessee. The Confederate

offensive was over, and the Union controlled Kentucky.

"," In Maj. Gen. Kirby Smith’s 1862 Confederate offensive into

Kentucky, Brig. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne led the advance with Col. John

S. ScottÂ’s cavalry out in front. The Rebel cavalry, while moving north

from Big Hill on the road to Richmond, Kentucky, on August 29, encountered

Union troopers and began skirmishing. After noon, Union artillery and infantry

joined the fray, forcing the Confederate cavalry to retreat to Big Hill.

At that time, Brig. Gen. Mahlon D. Manson, who commanded Union forces in

the area, ordered a brigade to march to Rogersville, toward the Rebels.

Fighting for the day stopped after pursuing Union forces briefly skirmished

with CleburneÂ’s men in late afternoon. That night, Manson informed his

superior, Maj. Gen. William Nelson, of his situation, and he ordered another

brigade to be ready to march in support, when required. Kirby Smith ordered

Cleburne to attack in the morning and promised to hurry reinforcements

(ChurchillÂ’s division). Cleburne started early, marching north, passed

through Kinston, dispersed Union skirmishers, and approached MansonÂ’s battle

line near Zion Church. As the day progressed, additional troops joined

both sides. Following an artillery duel, the battle began, and after a

concerted Rebel attack on the Union right, the Yankees gave way. Retreating

into Rogersville, the Yankees made another futile stand at their old bivouac.

By now, Smith and Nelson had arrived and taken command of their respective

armies. Nelson rallied some troops in the cemetery outside Richmond, but

they were routed. Nelson and some men escaped but the Rebels captured approximately

4,000 Yankees. The way north was open.

"," After Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell took command of the Department

of the Ohio in early November, he attempted to consolidate control by organizing

and sending troops into the field. He ordered Brig. Gen. Alexander McD.

McCook, commanding the 2nd Division, to Nolin, Kentucky. In the meantime,

the Confederates had established a defensive line along the Green River

near Munfordville. McCook launched a movement towards the enemy lines on

December 10, which the Rebels countered by partially destroying the Louisville

& Nashville Railroad bridge over the Green River. As a result, the

Union sent two companies of the 32nd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment

across the river to prevent a surprise and began constructing a pontoon

bridge for the passage of trains and artillery. When the bridge was completed

on December 17, four more of the 32nd Indiana companies crossed the river.

The combined force advanced to a hill south of Woodsonville where, in the

afternoon, they spotted enemy troops in the woods fronting them. Two companies

advanced toward the enemy in the woods, which fell back until Confederate

cavalry attacked. A general engagement ensued as eight Yankee companies

fought a much larger Confederate force. Fearing that the enemy might roll

up his right flank, Col. August Willich, commanding the regiment, ordered

a withdrawal to a stronger position in the rear. Knowing of McCookÂ’s approach,

the Rebels also withdrew from the field. Although the results of the battle

were indecisive, Union troops did occupy the area and insured the movement

Advancing west from Camp Moore, the Confederate land forces, coming from

the east, were only ten miles away on August 4. They reached the outskirts

of the capital early in the morning, formed for an attack in two divisions,

and began to drive back each Union unit they encountered. Then, Union gunboats

in the river began shelling the Confederates. The Arkansas could

have neutralized the Union gunboats, but her engines failed and she did

not participate in the battle. Federal land forces, in the meantime, fell

back to a more defensible line, and the Union commander, Brig. Gen. Thomas

Williams, was killed soon after. The new commander, Col. Thomas W. Cahill,

ordered a retreat to a prepared defensive line nearer the river and within

Gen. E. Kirby Smith’s Trans-Mississippi Department, headquartered in Shreveport,

Louisiana, in early 1864. Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks and Rear Adm. David

D. Porter jointly commanded the combined force. PorterÂ’s fleet and Brig.

Gen. A.J. Smith's XVI and XVII Army Corps detachments of the Army of the

Tennessee set out on March 12, 1864, up the Red River, the most direct

route to Shreveport. Banks with the XIII and XIX Army Corps advanced by

way of Berwick Bay and Bayou Teche. After removing various obstructions

that the Rebels had placed in the river, the major impediment to the Union

expedition was the formidable Fort DeRussy, an earthen fortification with

a partly iron-plated battery designed to resist the fire of Union ironclads

that might come up river. Union Brig. Gen. A.J. SmithÂ’s command had embarked

on transports at Vicksburg and then disembarked at Simsport, on the 12th,

about thirty miles from Fort DeRussy. Smith sent out some troops on the

morning of the 13th to determine if any enemy was in their path. This force

dispersed and chased an enemy brigade, after which, Smith set his men in

motion up the Fort DeRussy road. They did not proceed far before night.

Early the next morning, the 14th, they continued the march, discovering

that a Confederate division threatened their advance. Always mindful of

this threat, Smith had to place part of his command in a position to intercept

these Rebel forces if they attacked. Upon arriving at the fort, the enemy

garrison of 350 men opened fire. Smith decided to use MowerÂ’s division,

XVI Army Corps, to take the fort and set about positioning it for the attack.

Around 6:30 pm, Smith ordered a charge on the fort and about twenty minutes

later, MowerÂ’s men scaled the parapet, causing the enemy to surrender.

Fort DeRussy, which some had said was impregnable, had fallen and the Red

"," April 16-28, 1862


"," Early Union plans had called for the division of the Confederacy

by seizing control of the Mississippi River. One of the first steps in

such operations was to enter the mouth of the Mississippi River, ascend

to New Orleans and capture the city, closing off the entrance to Rebel

ships. In mid-January 1862, Flag-Officer David G. Farragut undertook this

enterprise with his West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The way was soon open

except for the two forts, Jackson and St. Philip, above the Head of the

Passes, approximately seventy miles below New Orleans. In addition to the

forts and their armament, the Confederates had placed obstructions in the

river and there were a number of ships, including two ironclads, to assist

in the defense. Farragut based his operations from Ship Island, Mississippi,

and on April 8, he assembled 24 of his vessels and Comdr. David D. Porter's

19 mortar schooners near the Head of the Passes. Starting on the 16th and

continuing for seven days, the mortar schooners bombarded Fort Jackson

but failed to silence its guns. Some of Farragut’s gunboats opened a way

through the obstruction on the night of the 22nd. Early on the morning

of the 24th, Farragut sent his ships north to pass the forts and head for

New Orleans. Although the Rebels attempted to stop the Union ships in various

ways, most of the force successfully passed the forts and continued on

to New Orleans where Farragut accepted the cityÂ’s surrender. With the passage

of the forts, nothing could stop the Union forces: the fall of New Orleans

was inevitable and anti-climatic. Cut off and surrounded, the garrisons

sugar and cotton products from there would come into Union hands and, in

the future, to use it as a base for other military operations. He organized

a brigade of about 4,000 men under the command of his protege Brig. Gen.

"," After Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river

parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore,

leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or

other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses

for food, clothing, etc. African-American troops were assigned to protect

these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined

to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an

to demand unconditional surrender first, which the Union forces accepted.

Later in the day, Confederate Col. W.H. Parsons fought companies of the

","  Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor sent an expedition under Col.

James P. Major to break Union supply lines, disrupt Union activities and

Major set out from Washington, Louisiana, on Bayou Teche, heading south

and plantations and in the process captured animals and supplies and liberated

slaves. Brig. Gen. William H. Emory, commanding the defenses of New Orleans,

assigned Lt. Col. Albert Stickney to command in Brashear City and to stem

the Rebel raid if possible. Emory informed Stickney of MajorÂ’s descent

on LaFourche Crossing and ordered him to send troops. Feeling that no threat

to Brashear City existed, Stickney, himself, led troops off to LaFourche

Crossing, arriving on the morning of the 20th. That afternoon, Stickney's

scouts reported that the enemy was advancing rapidly. The Rebel forces

began driving in StickneyÂ’s pickets around 5:00 pm. Confederate cavalry

then advanced but was driven back. After the Union troops fired a few rounds,

the Confederates withdrew in the direction of Thibodeaux. In the late afternoon

of the 21st, Confederate soldiers engaged the Union pickets, and fighting

continued for more than an hour before the Rebels retired. About 6:30 pm,

the Confederates reappeared in force, started an artillery duel, and charged

Taylor, commander of the Confederate forces in the area, decided, without

the Union army would be timid after Mansfield and that an audacious, well-coordinated

attack would be successful. The Confederates closed up, rested for a few

hours, and then attacked at 5:00 pm. Taylor planned to send a force to

assail the Union front while he rolled up the left flank and moved his

cavalry around the right flank to cut the escape route. The attack on the

Union left flank, under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Churchill,

succeeded in sending those enemy troops fleeing for safety. Churchill ordered

his men ahead, intending to attack the Union center from the rear. Union

troops, however, discerned the danger and hit ChurchillÂ’s right flank,

forcing a retreat.Â  Pleasant Hill was the last major battle, in terms

of numbers of men involved, of the Louisiana phase of the Red River Campaign.

Although Banks won this battle, he retreated, wishing to get his army out

of west Louisiana before any greater calamity occurred. The battles of

Mansfield and Pleasant Hill jointly (although the former was much more

force under Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace attempted to arrest EarlyÂ’s invading

Confederate divisions along the Monocacy River, just east of Frederick.

Wallace, joined by RickettsÂ’s Division of the VI Corps that had been rushed

from the Petersburg lines, was outflanked by GordonÂ’s Division and defeated

after putting up a stiff resistance. Hearing of EarlyÂ’s incursion into

Maryland, Grant embarked the rest of the VI Corps on transports at City

Point, sending it with all dispatch to Washington. WallaceÂ’s defeat at

Monocacy bought time for these veteran troops to arrive to bolster the

defenses of Washington. EarlyÂ’s advance reached the outskirts of Washington

on the afternoon of July 11, and the remaining divisions of the VI Corps

began disembarking that evening. Monocacy was called the Â“Battle that Saved

Washington.Â”

"," MS009

"," May 16, 1863

"," Following the Union occupation of Jackson, Mississippi,

both Confederate and Federal forces made plans for future operations. Gen.

Joseph E. Johnston retreated, with most of his army, up the Canton Road,

but he ordered Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton, commanding about 23,000 men,

to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton

and his generals felt that JohnstonÂ’s plan was dangerous and decided instead

to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On

May 16, though, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating

his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains

and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third

mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch,

his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the advance of his force.

On May 16, 1863, about 7:00 am, the Union forces engaged the Confederates

and the Battle of Champion Hill began. PembertonÂ’s force drew up into a

defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton

was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against

his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen.

Stephen D. Lee's men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the

reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops

and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the

Rebels off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the

Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion

House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant

arrived at Champion Hill, around 10:00 am, he ordered the attack to begin.

By 11:30 am, Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about

1:00 pm, they took the crest while the Rebels retired in disorder. The

Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson

Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (BowenÂ’s) then counterattacked,

pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge

came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had

just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. PembertonÂ’s men could not stand

up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape

route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen.

Lloyd TilghmanÂ’s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs,

including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized

the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates

were in full retreat towards Vicksburg. If the Union forces caught these

Rebels, they would destroy them.

"," After the Battle of Iuka, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price’s Confederate

Army of the West marched from Baldwyn to Ripley where it joined Maj. Gen.

Earl Van DornÂ’s Army of West Tennessee. Van Dorn was senior officer and

took command of the combined force numbering about 22,000 men. The Rebels

marched to Pocahontas on October 1, and then moved southeast toward Corinth.

They hoped to seize Corinth and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. Since

the Siege of Corinth, in the spring, Union forces had erected various fortifications,

an inner and intermediate line, to protect Corinth, an important transportation

center. With the Confederate approach, the Federals, numbering about 23,000,

occupied the outer line of fortifications and placed men in front of them.

Van Dorn arrived within three miles of Corinth at 10:00 am on October 3,

and moved into some fieldworks that the Confederates had erected for the

siege of Corinth. The fighting began, and the Confederates steadily pushed

the Yankees rearward. A gap occurred between two Union brigades which the

Confederates exploited around 1:00 pm. The Union troops moved back in a

futile effort to close the gap. Price then attacked and drove the Federals

back further to their inner line. By evening, Van Dorn was sure that he

could finish the Federals off during the next day. This confidence--combined

with the heat, fatigue, and water shortages--persuaded him to cancel any

further operations that day. Rosecrans regrouped his men in the fortifications

to be ready for the attack to come the next morning. Van Dorn had planned

to attack at daybreak, but Brig. Gen. Louis HÃ©bertÂ’s sickness postponed

it till 9:00 am. As the Confederates moved forward, Union artillery swept

the field causing heavy casualties, but the Rebels continued on. They stormed

Battery Powell and closed on Battery Robinett, where desperate hand-to-hand

fighting ensued. A few Rebels fought their way into Corinth, but the Federals

quickly drove them out. The Federals continued on, recapturing Battery

Powell, and forcing Van Dorn into a general retreat. Rosecrans postponed

any pursuit until the next day. As a result, Van Dorn was defeated, but

not destroyed or captured, at Hatchie Bridge, Tennessee, on October 5.

","Maj. Gen. Sterling Price’s Army of the West main column

marched into Iuka, Mississippi, on September 14. PriceÂ’s superior, Gen.

Braxton Bragg, the commander of the Confederate Army of the Mississippi,

who was leading an offensive deep into Kentucky, ordered him to prevent

Maj. Gen. William S. RosecransÂ’s Army of the Mississippi troops from moving

into Middle Tennessee and reinforcing Brig. Gen. James NegleyÂ’s division

of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos BuellÂ’s Army of the Ohio, which was garrisoning

Nashville. Price had about 14,000 men, and he was informed that, if necessary,

he could request assistance from Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, commanding the

District of the Mississippi, headquartered at Holly Springs. Maj. Gen.

Ulysses S. Grant, commanding the Army of the Tennessee, feared that Price

intended to go north to join Bragg against Buell. Grant devised a plan

for his left wing commander, Maj. Gen. E.O.C. Ord, and his men to advance

on Iuka from the west; RosecransÂ’s forces were to march from the southwest,

arrive at Iuka on the 18th, and make a coordinated attack the next day.

Ord arrived on time and skirmishing ensued between his reconnaissance patrol

and Confederate pickets, about six miles from Iuka, before nightfall. Rosecrans

informed Grant that he would not arrive at Iuka on the 18th but would begin

his march at 4:30 am, the next morning. On the 19th, Ord sent Price a message

demanding that he surrender, but Price refused. At the same time, Price

received dispatches from Van Dorn suggesting that their two armies rendezvous,

as soon as possible, at Rienzi for attacks on the Federal forces in the

area. Price informed Van Dorn that the military situation had changed so

he could not evacuate Iuka immediately. He did, however, issue orders for

his men to prepare for a march the next day, to rendezvous with Van Dorn.

RosecransÂ’s army marched early on the 19th, but, instead of using two roads

as directed, it followed the Jacinto (Bay Springs) Road. After considering

the amount of time that Rosecrans required to reach Iuka, Grant determined

that he probably would not arrive on the 19th, so he ordered Ord to await

the sound of fighting between Rosecrans and Price before engaging the Confederates.

As Rosecrans advanced, his men fought actions with Confederate troops at

points along the way. About 4:00 pm, just after ascending a hill, the Union

column halted because the Confederates were well-placed below in a ravine,

filled with timber and underbrush. The Confederates launched attacks up

the hill, capturing a six-gun Ohio battery, while the Federals counterattacked

from the ridge. Fighting, which Price later stated he had Â“never seen surpassed,Â”

continued until after dark; the Union troops camped for the night behind

the ridge. Price had redeployed troops from OrdÂ’s front to fight against

RosecransÂ’s people. Ord did nothing, later proclaiming that he never heard

any fighting and, therefore, never engaged the enemy; Grant also remarked

that he had heard no sounds of battle. Following the fighting on the 19th,

Price determined to reengage the enemy the next day, but his subordinates

convinced him, instead, to march to join Van Dorn, as earlier planned.

At the same time, Rosecrans redeployed his men for fighting the next day.

PriceÂ’s army evacuated via the uncovered Fulton Road, protected its rear

with a heavy rearguard and hooked up with Van Dorn five days later at Ripley.

Although Rosecrans was supposed to traverse Fulton Road and cover it, he

stated that he had not guarded the road because he feared dividing his

force; Grant later approved this decision. RosecransÂ’s army occupied Iuka

and then mounted a pursuit; the Confederate rearguard and overgrown terrain

prevented the Union pursuit from accomplishing much. The Federals should

have destroyed or captured PriceÂ’s army, but instead the Rebels joined

Van Dorn and assaulted Corinth in October.

"," May 14, 1863
"," On May 9, 1863, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston received a dispatch

from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to Â“proceed at once

to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field.Â” As he

arrived in Jackson on the 13th, from Middle Tennessee, he learned that

two army corps from the Union Army of the TennesseeÂ—the XV, under Maj.

Gen. William T. Sherman, and the XVII, under Maj. Gen. James Birdseye McPhersonÂ—were

advancing on Jackson, intending to cut the city and the railroads off from

Vicksburg. Johnston consulted with the local commander, Brig. Gen. John

Gregg, and learned that only about 6,000 troops were available to defend

the town. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to

defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10:00 am, both Union

army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate

resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11:00

am, when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed

the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation

was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Yankees

entered Jackson and had a celebration, hosted by Maj. Gen. U.S. Grant who

had been travelling with ShermanÂ’s corps, in the Bowman House. They then

"," MS012

"," February 14-20, 1864

"," From Vicksburg, Mississippi, Sherman launched a campaign

to take the important railroad center at Meridian and, if the situation

was favorable, push on to Selma, Alabama, and threaten Mobile. Sherman

ordered Brig. Gen. William Sooy Smith to lead a cavalry force of 7,000

men from Memphis, Tennessee, on February 1, 1864, south through Okolona,

along the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, and meet the rest of the Union force

at Meridian. With the main force of 20,000 men, Sherman set out on the

3rd for Meridian, but made feints toward various other locations. To counter

the threat, Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered troops to the

area from other localities. The Confederate commander in the area, Lt.

Gen. Leonidas Polk, consolidated a number of commands in and around Mortona,

but lost his nerve and retreated rapidly eastward. Cavalry units commanded

by Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee periodically skirmished with Sherman’s force.

As Sherman approached Meridian, he met stiffer resistance from combined

forces but steadily moved on. Polk finally realized that he could not stop

Sherman and evacuated Meridian on the 14th, removing some railroad rolling

stock to McDowellÂ’s Bluff. ShermanÂ’s troops entered Meridian the same day

and began destroying railroad track, continuing their work until the 19th.

Smith never arrived at Meridian. Sherman left Meridian on the 20th, headed

west by way of Canton, looking for Smith and his force. He did not discover

what happened to Smith until he arrived back at Vicksburg (see Okolona,

#MS013). Sherman had destroyed some important Confederate transportation

facilities but had to forget his aspirations for continuing into Alabama.

of approximately 20,000 men, Sherman set out on the 3rd for Meridian, but

made feints on various other locations. Against orders, Smith delayed ten

days, while waiting for reinforcements, and did not start out until February

11. Destroying crops and railroad track along the way, Smith’s force met

almost no opposition, and, before long, 1,000 former slaves were traveling

with them. Smith was supposed to rendezvous with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman

at Meridian on the 10th, but he never arrived there. Sherman left Meridian

on the 20th, due in part to apprehension over SmithÂ’s whereabouts. Smith

neared West Point, 90 miles north of Meridian, on the 20th, and he fought

with Confederate cavalry units at Prairie Station and Aberdeen. SmithÂ—knowing

that Nathan Bedford Forrest commanded the troops he was fighting, concerned

about the fate of the former slaves with him, and not knowing how many

of the enemy he facedÂ—decided to concentrate at Prairie Station, and, on

the morning of the 21st, he set out for West Point.Â  Shortly after

dawn on the 21st, Col. Jeffrey ForrestÂ’s Confederate cavalry brigade engaged

Smith. Withdrawing at times, Forrest drew Smith into a swamp west of the

Tombigbee River. Other Rebel troops arrived and the fighting intensified.

Smith was sure that this was a trap set for him, and, discerning that he

was greatly outnumbered, he ordered a retreat, leaving a rearguard. The

rearguard held off the Confederates for about two hours before withdrawing

in good order. About the same time, Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest arrived

and ordered a pursuit. Skirmishing occurred the rest of the day. At sunup

on the 22nd, the Rebels attacked Smith just south of Okolona on the prairie.

More Confederate troops arrived, causing breaks in the Union battle line,

precipitating a retreat. For most of the rest of the day, they engaged

in a running battle for a distance of eleven miles, with both sides attacking

and counterattacking. Col. Forrest was killed during one Rebel charge.

The Yankees finally broke off the fighting and headed for Pontotoc. Maj.

Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, the commander on the field, realized that

his men were nearly out of ammunition and did not order a pursuit. Mississippi

militia harassed Smith to the state line. Smith arrived in Collierville,

Tennessee, near Memphis, on the 26th. Although Smith had caused much destruction

during his expedition, Okolona forced him to retire before he could do

more. SmithÂ’s actions against ShermanÂ’s orders jeopardized the Meridian

Expedition.

the Spring of 1863, starting his army south, from MillikenÂ’s Bend, on the

west side of the Mississippi River. He intended to cross the river at Grand

there. Grant then marched farther south and crossed at Bruinsburg on April

30. Union forces came ashore, secured the landing area and, by late afternoon,

began marching inland. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson,

GrantÂ’s force ran into Rebel outposts after midnight and skirmished with

them for around three hours. After 3:00 am, the fighting stopped. Union

forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30

am, the Confederates engaged the Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals

forced the Rebels to fall back. The Confederates established new defensive

positions at different times during the day but they could not stop the

Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated

that the Confederates were unable to defend the Mississippi River line

and the Federals had secured their beachhead. The way to Vicksburg was

led one column, comprising his Missouri Cavalry Brigade, out of Pocahontas,

Arkansas, to assault Union posts around Hartville, Missouri. When he neared

Hartville, on January 9, he sent a detachment forward to reconnoiter. It

raided other Union installations in the area before catching up with MarmadukeÂ’s

column east of Marshfield. Marmaduke had received reports of Union troops

approaching to surround him and prepared for a confrontation. Col. Samuel

Merrill, commander of the approaching Union column, arrived in Hartville,

discovered that the garrison had already surrendered and set out after

the Confederates. A few minutes later, fighting began. Marmaduke feared

being cut off from his retreat route back to Arkansas so he pushed MerrillÂ’s

force back to Hartville, where it established a defense line. Here, a four-hour

battle ensued in which the Confederates suffered many casualties but compelled

the Yankees to retreat. Although they won the battle, the Confederates

panic. The Union retreat turned into a rout as some ran all the way to

Sarcoxie, more than ten miles away. Although the Confederates won the battle,

they were unable to maintain themselves in the area given the great numbers

of Union troops. Most Confederates retreated into northwest Arkansas. The

1862 Confederate victories in southwestern Missouri at Newtonia and ClarkÂ’s

Mill were the SouthÂ’s apogee in the area; afterwards, the only Confederates

in the area belonged to raiding columns.

","  Having accomplished little since taking command of the

Western Department, with headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, Maj. Gen.

John C. FrÃ©mont formulated a plan to clear Maj. Gen. Sterling PriceÂ’s

Rebels from the state and then, if possible, carry the war into Arkansas

and Louisiana. Leaving St. Louis on October 7, 1861, FrÃ©montÂ’s combined

force eventually numbered more than 20,000. His accompanying cavalry force,

numbering 5,000 men and other mounted troops, included Maj. Frank J. WhiteÂ’s

Prairie Scouts and FrÃ©mont's Body Guards under Maj. Charles Zagonyi.

Maj. White became ill and turned his command over to Zagonyi. These two

units operated in front of FrÃ©montÂ’s army to gather intelligence.

As FrÃ©mont neared Springfield, the local state guard commander,

Col. Julian Frazier, sent out requests to nearby localities for additional

troops. FrÃ©mont camped on the Pomme de Terre River, about 50 miles

from Springfield. ZagonyiÂ’s column, though, continued on to Springfield,

and FrazierÂ’s force of 1,000 to 1,500 prepared to meet it. Frazier set

up an ambush along the road that Zagonyi travelled, but the Union force

charged the Rebels, sending them fleeing. ZagonyiÂ’s men continued into

town, hailed Federal sympathizers and released Union prisoners. Leery of

a Confederate counterattack, Zagonyi departed Springfield before night,

but FrÃ©montÂ’s army returned, in force, a few days later and set

up camp in the town. In mid-November, after FrÃ©mont was sacked and

replaced by Maj. Gen. Hunter, the Federals evacuated Springfield and withdrew

to Sedalia and Rolla. Federal troops reoccupied Springfield in early 1862

and it was a Union stronghold from then on. This engagement at Springfield

plans to attack the other. About 5:00 am on the 10th, Lyon, in two columns

commanded by himself and Col. Franz Sigel, attacked the Confederates on

WilsonÂ’s Creek about 12 miles southwest of Springfield. Rebel cavalry received

soon rushed up and stabilized their positions. The Confederates attacked

the Union forces three times that day but failed to break through the Union

line. Lyon was killed during the battle and Maj. Samuel D. Sturgis replaced

him. Meanwhile, the Confederates had routed SigelÂ’s column, south of SkeggÂ’s

the Confederates withdrew. Sturgis realized, however, that his men were

exhausted and his ammunition was low, so he ordered a retreat to Springfield.

The Confederates were too disorganized and ill-equipped to pursue. This

Confederate victory buoyed southern sympathizers in Missouri and served

","  March 26-28, 1862

"," Glorieta Pass was a strategic location, situated at the

southern tip of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, southeast of Santa Fe,

and on the Santa Fe Trail. In March 1862, a Confederate force of 200-300

Texans under the command of Maj. Charles L. Pyron encamped at JohnsonÂ’s

Ranch, at one end of the pass. Union Maj. John M. Chivington led more than

400 soldiers to the Pass and on the morning of March 26 moved out to attack.

After noon, ChivingtonÂ’s men captured some Rebel advance troops and then

found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their

artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two

sides of the pass, caught the Rebels in a crossfire, and soon forced them

to retire. Pyron and his men retired about a mile and a half to a narrow

section of the pass and formed a defensive line before ChivingtonÂ’s men

appeared. The Yankees flanked PyronÂ’s men again and punished them with

enfilade fire. The Confederates fled again and the Union cavalry charged,

capturing the rearguard. Chivington then retired and went into camp at

KozlowskiÂ’s Ranch. No fighting occurred the next day as reinforcements

arrived for both sides. Lt. Col. William R. ScurryÂ’s troops swelled the

Rebel ranks to about 1,100 while Union Col. John P. Slough arrived with

about 900 men. Both Slough and Scurry decided to attack and set out early

on the 28th to do so. As Scurry advanced down the canyon, he saw the Union

forces approaching, so he established a battle line, including his dismounted

cavalry. Slough hit them before 11:00 am. The Confederates held their ground

and then attacked and counterattacked throughout the afternoon. The fighting

then ended as Slough retired first to PigeonÂ’s Ranch and then to KozlowskiÂ’s

Ranch. Scurry soon left the field also, thinking he had won the battle.

ChivingtonÂ’s men, how-ever, had destroyed all ScurryÂ’s supplies and animals

at JohnsonÂ’s Ranch, forcing him to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step

on the long road back to San Antonio, Texas. The Federals had won and,

thereby, stopped Confederate incursions into the Southwest. Glorieta Pass

was the turning point of the war in the New Mexico Territory.

north of Fort Craig, New Mexico, hoping to cut Federal communications between

the fort and military headquarters in Santa Fe. Union Col. E.R.S. Canby

left Fort Craig with more than 3,000 men to prevent the Confederates from

crossing the river. When he was opposite them, across the river, Canby

opened fire and sent Union cavalry over, forcing the Rebels back. The Confederates

halted their retirement at the Old Rio Grande riverbed, which served as

an excellent position. After crossing all his men, Canby decided that a

frontal assault would fail and deployed his force to assault and turn the

Confederate left flank. Before he could do so, though, the Rebels attacked.

Federals rebuffed a cavalry charge, but the main Confederate force made

a frontal attack, capturing six artillery pieces and forcing the Union

battle line to break and many of the men to flee. Canby ordered a retreat.

Confederate reinforcements arrived and Sibley was about to order another

attack when Canby asked for a truce, by a white flag, to remove the bodies

Santee had joined forces with the Teton Sioux. Having marched all day on

July 24, 1863, Sibley’s scouts, around 1:00 pm, reported that they had

spotted a large Native American camp a few miles away. Sibley established

a camp on a nearby salt lake and set his men to entrenching it for protection.Â 

While in the process of making camp, numerous Native Americans appeared

expressing friendship. A number of them approached the scouts gathered

about 300-400 yards from the camp and began talking with them. Surgeon

Josiah S. Weiser, 1st Regiment Minnesota Mounted Rangers, joined the assembly,

but soon afterwards a Sioux shot and killed him. The scouts attempted to

kill the attacker but he escaped. Native Americans who had hidden behind

the surrounding ridges now emerged and attacked. In detachments, the soldiers

went out to meet the Native Americans. Sibley, with some men, approached

the Â“Big MoundÂ” on the opposite side of the ravine. He attempted to dislodge

those Sioux who were on the upper part of the large ravine firing at the

infantry and cavalry with impunity. The Union forces displaced these and

other well-placed Sioux in the surrounding ridges by accurate artillery

fire and forced them into the broken prairie where they fled in confusion.

The mounted troops, with some of the infantry and artillery following,

set out in pursuit. A running battle ensued for the rest of the day.Â 

Before dark, the soldiers broke off the pursuit and returned to camp as

previously ordered, some not arriving until the next morning. The Sioux

forces were broken and dispirited.

"," Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully, who had defeated the recalcitrant

Sioux at Whitestone Hill in September 1863, wintered on the Missouri River.

During the winter, SullyÂ’s superior, Maj. Gen. John Pope, formulated a

plan for ending the difficulties with the Sioux.Â  He would order a

force of about 2,500 men, commanded by Sully, into the field to find the

Native Americans and engage them in battle. In addition, he would send

infantry behind SullyÂ’s force to establish strong-posts in the Â“Indian

country.Â”Â  Thus, Minnesota troops were ordered to meet SullyÂ’s force

at the mouth of Burdache Creek on the Upper Missouri for active campaigning.Â 

The two columns rendezvoused on June 30 and set out against the Sioux.

They established Fort Rice on July 7 at the mouth of Cannonball River and

moved on. The Sioux, who had been operating north of Fort Rice, moved across

the Missouri River and took a strong position on the Little Missouri River,

about 200 miles from the fort. On July 26, Sully marched out to engage

them in battle.Â  On the 28th, he arrived near the Native American

camp which he reported included 5,000-6,000 warriors Â“strongly posted in

wooded country, very much cut up with high, rugged hills, and deep, impassible

ravines.Â” Sully met with some of the tribal chiefs first, but nothing came

of it so he attacked. Heavy fighting ensued, but eventually the artillery

and long-range firearms took effect and the Sioux began losing ground.

The retirement turned into flight. The Native Americans left all their

possessions, and a running fight of almost nine miles scattered the warriors

who were not wounded or killed. Killdeer Mountain broke the back of the

Sioux resistance.Â  Sully did meet the remnants of the Sioux warriors

that had escaped Killdeer Mountain in August and defeated them, but they

had none of the spirit formally exhibited.

","  Following Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley’s victories

over the Sioux, he left the area, crossing the James River. The Sioux then

recrossed the Missouri River and returned to their old hunting grounds.

Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully decided to find these Sioux and punish them, if

possible. By September 3, Sully reached a lake where he found numerous

remains of recently killed buffalo. A 6th Iowa Cavalry detachment discovered

a Native American camp of more than 400 lodges, about 3:00 pm, which they

endeavored to surround until a courier could inform Sully. Word reached

Sully around 4:00 pm, and he set out with the rest of the troops, except

for the poorly mounted men who remained to protect the animals and supplies.

About an hour later, Sully and his men arrived at the Sioux camp and observed

that the Sioux were attempting to leave. Sully sent in his troops to help

the 6th Iowa Cavalry. Although the Sioux did counterattack, it was to no

avail. The Sioux eventually broke under the firepower and fled, hotly pursued.

Fighting subsided after dark but scattered firing continued. Sully ordered

the bugler to sound rally, and all the troops remained at arms during the

rest of the night. In the morning, Sully established a camp on the battlefield

and, during the next two days, sent out scouting parties looking for remnants

of the enemy. He also ordered the destruction of Native American foodstuffs,

supplies, etc., found in the area. On September 5, one officer and 27 men

from the 2nd Nebraska and 6th Iowa Cavalry regiments went in search of

a surgeon and eight men missing since the battle on the 3rd. About 15 miles

northwest of camp, they were attacked by a party of about 300 Sioux. The

men could not stand up to this number of the enemy and began a slow retreat

while returning fire.Â  As the enemy came closer, the men panicked

and stepped up their retirement despite entreaties from the officers. They

eventually returned to camp and safety, after losing six men in the skirmish.

Altogether, SullyÂ’s men overran a large Sioux camp, destroyed much of the

contents, killed or wounded a large number of men, and captured numerous

women and children. This engagement weakened but did not destroy the Native

American resistance in the area.

"," Confederate troops had undertaken a campaign to subdue

the Native American Union sympathizers in Indian Territory and consolidate

control. They had attacked Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s band of Creeks and Seminoles

earlier at Round Mountain and Chusto-Talasah. Now, they wanted to finish

them off by assaulting them in their camp at Chustenahlah in a well-protected

cove on Battle Creek. Col. James McQueen McIntosh and Col. Douglas H. Cooper,

commanding the Indian Department, planned a combined attack with each of

their columns moving on the camp from different directions. McIntosh left

Fort Gibson on December 22, with 1,380 men. On the 25th, he was informed

that CooperÂ’s force could not join for a while, but he decided to attack

the next day, despite being outnumbered. McIntosh attacked the camp at

noon on the 26th. The Union defenders were secluded in the underbrush along

the slope of a rugged hill, but as the Confederate attack came forward,

the Native Americans began to fall back, taking cover for a while and then

moving back. The retreat became a rout as the Federals reached their camp.

They attempted to make a stand there but were forced away again. The survivors

fled;Â  many went all the way to Kansas where they found loyal Unionists.

Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s band of Creeks and Seminoles mounted no resistance

again.

the Horseshoe Bend of Bird Creek when Col. Douglas H. CooperÂ’s 1,300 Confederates

was coming and had placed his troops in a strong position at Horseshoe

Bend. For almost four hours, Cooper attacked and attempted to outflank

the Federals, finally driving them east across Bird Creek just before dark.

Cooper camped there overnight but did not pursue the Federals because he

was short of ammunition.Â  The Confederates claimed victory. Chief

Native American troops under the command of Brig. Gen. Douglas H. Cooper,

were about to concentrate and would then attack his force at Fort Gibson.

He decided to defeat the Confederates at Honey Springs Depot before they

Smith, Arkansas. Blunt began crossing the swollen Arkansas River on July

15, 1863, and, by midnight on July 16-17, he had a force of 3,000 men,

composed of whites, Native Americans, and African Americans, marching toward

Honey Springs. Blunt skirmished with Rebel troops early on the morning

of the 17th, and by midafternoon, full-scale fighting ensued. The Confederates

had wet powder, causing misfires, and the problem intensified when rain

began.Â  After repulsing one attack, Cooper pulled his forces back

to obtain new ammunition. In the meantime, Cooper began to experience command

problems, and he learned that Blunt was about to turn his left flank. The

Confederate retreat began, and although Cooper fought a rearguard action,

many of those troops counterattacked, failed, and fled. Any possibility

of the Confederates taking Fort Gibson was gone. Following this battle,

Union forces controlled Indian Territory, north of the Arkansas River.

"," Col. Douglas H. Cooper, Confederate commander of the Indian

Department, had not been able to reconcile differences with Chief Opothleyahola,

who commanded a band of Unionist Creeks and Seminoles. Cooper set out on

November 15, 1861, with about 1,400 men toÂ  either compel submission

. . . or “drive him and his party from the country.Â”Â  His force rode

up the Deep Fork of the Canadian River towards Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s camp

that part of Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s band was at the Red Fork of the Arkansas

River, where they were erecting a fort. CooperÂ’s men arrived there around

4:00 pm and ordered a cavalry charge which discovered that Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s

band had recently abandoned the camp. The Confederates did find some stragglers

beyond the camp and followed them, blundering into Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s

camp. The Federals fired into the Rebel cavalry and, in large force, came

out to attack them. They chased the Confederates back to CooperÂ’s main

force. Darkness prevented Cooper from attacking until the main enemy force

was within 60 yards. A short fight ensued but Chief OpothleyaholaÂ’s men

broke it off and retreated back to their camp. Cooper set out for Chief

OpothleyaholaÂ’s camp the next morning but found it gone. The Confederates

for an assault. Soon, the battle started and continued throughout most
of the day. Confederate flanking attacks and other assaults occurred at
various times and locations, but the Federals held until southern reinforcements
tipped the scales. By nightfall, the Federals were retiring from BeanÂ’s
Station through BeanÂ’s Gap and on to BlainÂ’s Cross Roads. Longstreet set
out to attack the Union forces again the next morning, but as he approached
them at BlainÂ’s Cross Roads, he found them well-entrenched. Longstreet
withdrew and the Federals soon left the area. The Knoxville Campaign ended
following the battle of BeanÂ’s Station. Longstreet soon went into winter
quarters at Russellville. Their success meant little to Confederate efforts
except to prevent disaster.

"," Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, commander of the Department
of the Ohio, undertook an expedition into East Tennessee to clear the roads
and passes to Virginia, and, if possible, secure the saltworks beyond Abingdon.
In October, Confederate Brig. Gen. John S. Williams, with his cavalry force,
set out to disrupt Union communications and logistics. He wished to take
Bull’s Gap on the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad. On October 3,
while advancing on BullÂ’s Gap, he fought with Brig. Gen. Samuel P. CarterÂ’s
Union Cavalry Division, XXIII Army Corps, at Blue Springs, about nine miles
from BullÂ’s Gap, on the railroad. Carter, not knowing how many of the enemy
he faced, withdrew. Carter and Williams skirmished for the next few days.
On October 10, Carter approached Blue Springs in force. Williams had received
some reinforcements. The battle began about 10:00 am with Union cavalry
engaging the Confederates until afternoon while another mounted force attempted
to place itself in a position to cut off a Rebel retreat. Captain Orlando
M. Poe, the Chief Engineer, performed a reconnaissance to identify the
best location for making an infantry attack. At 3:30 pm, Brig. Gen. Edward
FerreroÂ’s 1st Division, IX Army Corps, moved up to attack, which he did
at 5:00 pm. FerreroÂ’s men broke into the Confederate line, causing heavy
casualties, and advanced almost to the enemyÂ’s rear before being checked.
After dark, the Confederates withdrew and the Federals took up the pursuit
in the morning. Within days, Williams and his men had retired to Virginia.
Burnside had launched the East Tennessee Campaign to reduce or extinguish
Confederate influence in the area; Blue Springs helped fulfill that mission.

initially retired in front of this force and, on November 10, were at BullÂ’s

the Confederates sought to hit the Union forces in a variety of locations
but they gained little. The next day firing occurred throughout most of
the day, but the Confederates did not assault the Union lines because they
were marching to flank them on the right. Before making the flank attack,
the Union forces, short on everything from ammunition to rations, withdrew
from BullÂ’s Gap after midnight on the 4th. Breckinridge pursued, but the
Federals received reinforcements and foul weather played havoc with the
roads and streams. Breckinridge, with most of his force, retired back to
Virginia. This victory was a temporary Union setback in the Federal plans
to rid East Tennessee of Confederate influence.

"," In early November 1863, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, with
two divisions and about 5,000 cavalry, was detached from the Confederate
Army of Tennessee near Chattanooga to attack Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. BurnsideÂ’s
Union Department of the Ohio troops at Knoxville, Tennessee. Following
parallel routes, Longstreet and Burnside raced for CampbellÂ’s Station,
a hamlet where the Concord Road, from the south, intersected the Kingston
Road to Knoxville. Burnside hoped to reach the crossroads first and continue
on to safety in Knoxville; Longstreet planned to reach the crossroads and
hold it, which would prevent Burnside from gaining Knoxville and force
him to fight outside his earthworks. By forced marching, on a rainy November
16, Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. BurnsideÂ’s advance reached the vital intersection
and deployed first. The main column arrived at noon with the baggage train
just behind. Scarcely 15 minutes later, LongstreetÂ’s Confederates approached.
Longstreet attempted a double envelopment: attacks timed to strike both
Union flanks simultaneously. Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLawÂ’s Confederate division
struck with such force that the Union right had to redeploy, but held.
Brig. Gen. Micah JenkinsÂ’s Confederate division maneuvered ineffectively
as it advanced and was unable to turn the Union left. Burnside ordered
his two divisions astride the Kingston Road to withdraw three-quarters
of a mile to a ridge in their rear. This was accomplished without confusion.
The Confederates suspended their attack while Burnside continued his retrograde
movement to Knoxville. Had Longstreet reached Campbell's Station first,
the Knoxville CampaignÂ’s results might have been different.

"," In late Spring 1862, the Confederacy split its forces in
Tennessee into several small commands in an attempt to complicate Federal
operations. The Union had to redistribute its forces to counter the Confederate
command structure changes. Maj. Gen. Ormsby Mitchel received orders to
go to Huntsville, Alabama, with his division to repair railroads in the
area. Soon, he occupied more than 100 miles along the Nashville & Chattanooga
and Memphis & Charleston railroads.Â  In May, Mitchel and his men
sparred with Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith’s men. After Mitchel received
command of all Federal troops between Nashville and Huntsville, on May
29, he ordered Brig. Gen. James Negley with a small division to lead an
expedition to capture Chattanooga. This force arrived before Chattanooga
on June 7. Negley ordered the 79th Pennsylvania Volunteers out to reconnoiter.
It found the Confederates entrenched on the opposite side of the river
along the banks and atop Cameron Hill. Negley brought up two artillery
batteries to open fire on the Rebel troops and the town and sent infantry
to the river bank to act as sharpshooters. The Union bombardment of Chattanooga
continued throughout the 7th and until noon on the 8th. The Confederates
replied, but it was uncoordinated since the undisciplined gunners were
allowed to do as they wished. On June 10, Smith, who had arrived on the
8th, reported that Negley had withdrawn and the Confederate loss was minor.Â 
This attack on Chattanooga was a warning that Union troops could mount
assaults when they wanted.

"," Since the Battle of Dandridge, the Union cavalry had moved
to the south side of the French Broad River and had disrupted Confederate
foraging and captured numerous wagons in that area. On January 25, 1864,
Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, commander of the Department of East Tennessee,
instructed his subordinates to do something to curtail Union operations
south of the French Broad. On the 26th, Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis, having
had various brushes with Confederate cavalry, deployed his troopers to
watch the area fords. Two Confederate cavalry brigades and artillery advanced
from Fair Garden in the afternoon but were checked about four miles from
Sevierville. Other Confederates attacked a Union cavalry brigade, though,
at Fowler’s on Flat Creek, and drove it about two miles. No further fighting
occurred that day. Union scouts observed that the Confederates had concentrated
on the Fair Garden Road, so Sturgis ordered an attack there in the morning.
In a heavy fog, Col. Edward M. McCookÂ’s Union division attacked and drove
back Maj. Gen. William T. MartinÂ’s Confederates until about 4:00 pm. At
that time, McCookÂ’s men charged with sabers and routed the Rebels. Sturgis
set out in pursuit on the 28th, and captured and killed more of the routed
Rebels. The Union forces, however, observed three of LongstreetÂ’s infantry
brigades crossing the river. Realizing his weariness from fighting, lack
of supplies, ammunition, and weapons and the overwhelming strength of the
enemy, Sturgis decided to evacuate the area. But, before leaving, Sturgis
determined to attack Brig. Gen. Frank C. ArmstrongÂ’s Confederate cavalry
division which he had learned was about three or four miles away, on the
river.Â  Unbeknownst to the attacking Federals, Armstrong had strongly
fortified his position and three infantry regiments had arrived to reinforce
him. Thus, the Union troops suffered severe casualties in the attack. The
battle continued until dark, when the Federals retired from the area. The
Federals had won the big battle but the fatigue of continual fighting and
lack of supplies and ammunition forced them to withdraw.

Mississippi River about forty river miles above Memphis, comprised 295

white Tennessee troops and 262 U.S. Colored Troops, all under the command

of Maj. Lionel F. Booth. Confederate Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest attacked

the fort on April 12 with a cavalry division of approximately 2,500 men.

Forrest seized the older outworks, with high knolls commanding the Union

position, to surround BoothÂ’s force. Rugged terrain prevented the gunboat

New Era from providing effective fire support for the Federals. The garrison

was unable to depress its artillery enough to cover the approaches to the

fort Rebel sharpshooters, on the surrounding knolls, began firing into

the fort killing Booth. Maj. William F. Bradford then took over command

of the garrison. The Confederates launched a determined attack at 11:00

am, occupying more strategic locations around the fort, and Forrest demanded

unconditional surrender. Bradford asked for an hour for consultation, and

Forrest granted twenty minutes.Â  Bradford refused surrender and the

Confederates renewed the attack, soon overran the fort, and drove the Federals

down the riverÂ’s bluff into a deadly crossfire. Casualties were high and

only sixty-two of the U.S. Colored Troops survived the fight. Many accused

the Confederates of perpetrating a massacre of the black troops, and that

controversy continues today. The Confederates evacuated Fort Pillow that

evening so they gained little from the attack except a temporary disruption

of Union operations. The Â“Fort Pillow MassacreÂ”Â  became a Union rallying

cry and cemented resolve to see the war through to its conclusion.

" Knoxville Campaign (1863)

"," TN025

"," November 29, 1863

"," In attempting to take Knoxville, the Confederates decided
that Fort Sanders was the only vulnerable place where they could penetrate
Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside’s fortifications, which enclosed the
city, and successfully conclude the siege, already a week long. The fort
surmounted an eminence just northwest of Knoxville. Northwest of the fort,
the land dropped off abruptly. Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet believed
he could assemble a storming party, undetected at night, below the fortifications
and, before dawn, overwhelm Fort Sanders by a coup de main. Following a
brief artillery barrage directed at the fortÂ’s interior, three Rebel brigades
charged. Union wire entanglements-Â–telegraph wire stretched from one tree
stump to another to another-Â–delayed the attack, but the fortÂ’s outer ditch
halted the Confederates. This ditch was twelve feet wide and from four
to ten feet deep with vertical sides. The fortÂ’s exterior slope was almost
vertical, also. Crossing the ditch was nearly impossible, especially under
withering defensive fire from musketry and canister.Â  Confederate
officers did lead their men into the ditch, but, without scaling ladders,
few emerged on the scarp side and a small number entered the fort to be
wounded, killed, or captured. The attack lasted a short twenty minutes.
Longstreet undertook his Knoxville expedition to divert Union troops from
Chattanooga and to get away from Gen. Braxton Bragg, with whom he was engaged
in a bitter feud. His failure to take Knoxville scuttled his purpose. This
was the decisive battle of the Knoxville Campaign. This Confederate defeat,
plus the loss of Chattanooga on November 25, put much of East Tennessee
in the Union camp.

"," The 1863 engagement at Franklin was a reconnaissance in
force by Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn coupled with
an equally inept response by Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. Van Dorn advanced
northward from Spring Hill on May 10, making contact with Federal skirmishers
just outside Franklin. Van Dorn’s attack was so weak that when Granger
received a false report that Brentwood, to the north, was under attack,
he believed it, and sent away most of his cavalry, thinking that the Confederate
general was undertaking a diversion. When the truth became knownÂ—there
was no threat to BrentwoodÂ— Granger decided to attack Van Dorn, but he
was surprised to learn that a subordinate had already done so, without
orders. Brig. Gen. David S. Stanley, with a cavalry brigade, had crossed
the Harpeth River at HughesÂ’s Ford, behind the Confederate right rear.
The 4th U.S. Cavalry attacked and captured FreemanÂ’s Tennessee Battery
on the Lewisburg Road but lost it when Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest
counterattacked. StanleyÂ’s troopers quickly withdrew across the Big Harpeth
River. This incident in his rear caused Van Dorn to cancel his operations
and withdraw to Spring Hill, leaving the Federals in control of the area.

frontal attack against the Union perimeter. Two Federal brigades holding
a forward position gave way and retreated to the inner works, but their

When the battle ceased, after dark, six Confederate generals were dead

Bragg, commander of the Army of Tennessee, established a fortified line
along the Duck River from Shelbyville to Wartrace. On the Confederate right,
infantry and artillery detachments guarded Liberty, HooverÂ’s, and Bellbuckle
gaps through the mountains. RosecransÂ’s superiors, fearing that Bragg might
detach large numbers of men to help break the Siege of Vicksburg, urged
him to attack the Confederates. On June 23, 1863, he feigned an attack
on Shelbyville but massed against BraggÂ’s right. His troops struck out
toward the gaps, Maj. Gen. George H. ThomasÂ’s men, on the 24th, forced
HooverÂ’s Gap. The Confederate 3rd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Col.

continued at the gap until just before noon on the 26th, when Maj. Gen.
Alexander P. Stewart, the Confederate division commander, sent a message
to Johnson and Bate stating that he was pulling back and they should also.
Although slowed by rain, Rosecrans moved on, forcing Bragg to give up his
defensive line and fall back to Tullahoma. Rosecrans sent a flying column
(WilderÂ’s Lightning Brigade, the same that had spearheaded the thrust through

"," The engagement at Jackson occurred during Brig. Gen. Nathan
Bedford ForrestÂ’s Expedition into West Tennessee, between December 11,
1862, and January 1, 1863. Forrest wished to interrupt the rail supply
line to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. GrantÂ’s army, campaigning down the Mississippi
Central Railroad. If he could destroy the Mobile & Ohio Railroad running
south from Columbus, Kentucky, through Jackson, Grant would have to curtail
or halt his operations. ForrestÂ’s 2,100-man cavalry brigade crossed the
Tennessee River on December 15-17, heading west.Â  Maj. Gen. Grant
ordered a troop concentration at Jackson under Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan
and sent a cavalry force out under Col. Robert G. Ingersoll, to confront
Forrest. Forrest, however, smashed the Union cavalry at Lexington on December
18. As Forrest continued his advance the next day, Sullivan ordered Col.
Adolph Englemann to take a small force northeast of Jackson. At Old Salem
Cemetery, acting on the defensive, EnglemannÂ’s two infantry regiments repulsed
a Confederate mounted attack and then withdrew a mile closer to town. To
Forrest, the fight amounted to no more than a feint and show of force intended
to hold JacksonÂ’s Union defenders in place while two mounted columns destroyed
railroad track north and south of the town and returned.Â  This accomplished,
Forrest withdrew from the Jackson area to attack Trenton and Humboldt.
Thus, although the Federals had checked a demonstration by a portion of
ForrestÂ’s force, a major accomplishment, other Confederates had fulfilled
an element of the expeditionÂ’s mission.

"," In an effort to check the Union armyÂ’s advance through
Georgia, Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest led a 23-day raid culminating
in an attack on the Yankee supply base at Johnsonville, Tennessee. Swinging
north from Corinth, Mississippi, toward the Kentucky border and temporarily
blockading the Tennessee River at Fort Herman, Forrest then moved southward
along the Tennessee RiverÂ’s west bank, capturing several U.S. steamers
and a gunboat which he later had to abandon. On November 4, Forrest began
positioning his artillery across the river from the Federal supply base
and landing at Johnsonville. The Union discovered the Confederates finishing
their entrenchments and battery emplacements in the afternoon of the 4th.
The Union gunboats and land batteries, across the river, engaged the Confederates
in an artillery duel. The Rebel guns, however, were so well-positioned,
the Federals were unable to hinder them. In fact, Confederate artillery
fire disabled the gunboats. Fearing that the Rebels might cross the river
and capture the transports, the Federals set fire to them. The wind then
extended the fire to the piles of stores on the levee and to a warehouse
loaded with supplies. Seeing the fire, the Confederates began firing on
the steamboats, barges, and warehouses to prevent the Federals from putting
out the fire. An inferno illuminated ForrestÂ’s night withdrawal, and he
escaped Union clutches without serious loss. Damages totaled $2.2 million.
The next morning, on the 5th, some Confederate artillery bombarded the
depot in the morning but then left. Although this brilliant victory further
strengthened ForrestÂ’s reputation and destroyed a great amount of Union
materiel, it failed to stem the tide of Union success in Georgia. By this
time, Forrest often harassed the Union Army, but, as this engagement demonstrated,
he could not stop their operations.

troops. The raid had three objectives:Â  to capture three Union generals
posted there;Â  to release Southern prisoners from Irving Block Prison;
and to cause the recall of Union forces from Northern Mississippi. Striking
northwestward for Memphis with 2,000 cavalry, Forrest lost about a quarter

Taking advantage of a thick dawn fog and claiming to be a Union patrol
returning with prisoners, the Confederates eliminated the sentries. Galloping
through the streets and exchanging shots with other Union troops, the raiders
split to pursue separate missions.Â  One Union general was not at his
quarters and another escaped to Fort Pickering dressed in his night-shirt.
The attack on Irving Block Prison also failed when Union troops stalled
the main body at the State Female College. After two hours, Forrest decided
to withdraw, cutting telegraph wires, taking 500 prisoners and large quantities
of supplies, including many horses. Although Forrest failed in Memphis,
his raid influenced Union forces to return there, from northern Mississippi,

"," In a last, desperate attempt to force Maj. Gen. William
T. ShermanÂ’s army out of Georgia, Gen. John Bell Hood led the Army of Tennessee
north toward Nashville in November 1864. Although he suffered a terrible
loss at Franklin, he continued toward Nashville. In operating against Nashville,
he decided that destruction of the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad
and disruption of the Union army supply depot at Murfreesboro would help
his cause. He sent Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, on December 4, with
an expedition, composed of two cavalry divisions and Maj. Gen. William
B. BateÂ’s infantry division, to Murfreesboro. On December 2, Hood had ordered
Bate to destroy the railroad and blockhouses between Murfreesboro and Nashville
and join Forrest for further operations;Â  on December 4, BateÂ’s division
attacked Blockhouse No. 7 protecting the railroad crossing at Overall Creek,
but Union forces fought it off. On the morning of the 5th, Forrest headed
out toward Murfreesboro, splitting his force, one column to attack the
fort on the hill and the other to take Blockhouse No. 4, both at La Vergne.
Upon his demand for surrender at both locations, the Union garrisons did
so. Outside La Vergne, Forrest hooked up with BateÂ’s division and the command
advanced on to Murfreesboro along two roads, driving the Yankees into their
Fortress Rosencrans fortifications, and encamped in the city outskirts
for the night. The next morning, on the 6th, Forrest ordered BateÂ’s division
to Â“move upon the enemyÂ’s works.Â” Fighting flared for a couple of hours,
but the Yankees ceased firing and both sides glared at each other for the
rest of the day. Brig. Gen. Claudius SearsÂ’s and Brig. Gen. Joseph B. PalmerÂ’s
infantry brigades joined ForrestÂ’s command in the evening, further swelling
his numbers. On the morning of the 7th, Maj. Gen. Lovell Rousseau, commanding
all of the forces at Murfreesboro, sent two brigades out under Brig. Gen.
Robert Milroy on the Salem Pike to feel out the enemy. These troops engaged
the Confederates and fighting continued. At one point some of ForrestÂ’s
troops broke and ran causing disorder in the Rebel ranks; even entreaties
from Forrest and Bate did not stem the rout of these units. The rest of
ForrestÂ’s command conducted an orderly retreat from the field and encamped
for the night outside Murfreesboro. Forrest had destroyed railroad track,
blockhouses, and some homes and generally disrupted Union operations in

response to the threat, the Confederate government sent Brig. Gen. Nathan
Bedford Forrest to Chattanooga to organize a cavalry brigade. By July,
Confederate cavalry under the command of Forrest and Col. John Hunt Morgan

dramatic of these cavalry raids was Forrest’s capture of the Union Murfreesboro
garrison on July 13, 1862. Forrest left Chattanooga on July 9 with two
cavalry regiments and joined other units on the way, bringing the total

morning of July 13, ForrestÂ’s cavalry surprised the Union pickets on the
Woodbury Pike, east of Murfreesboro, and quickly overran a Federal hospital
and the camp of the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment detachment.Â 
Additional Rebel troops attacked the camps of the other Union commands
and the jail and courthouse. By late afternoon all of the Union units had
surrendered to ForrestÂ’s force. The Confederates destroyed much of the
Union supplies and tore up railroad track in the area, but the main result
of the raid was the diversion of Union forces from a drive on Chattanooga.
This raid, along with MorganÂ’s raid into Kentucky, made possible BraggÂ’s
concentration of forces at Chattanooga and his early September invasion
of Kentucky.

" Franklin-Nashville Campaign (1864)

"," TN038

"," December 15-16, 1864

"," In a last desperate attempt to force Maj. Gen. William
T. Sherman’s army out of Georgia, Gen. John Bell Hood led the Army of Tennessee
north toward Nashville in November 1864.Â  Although he sufferedÂ 
terrible losses at Franklin on November 30, he continued toward Nashville.
By the next day, the various elements of Maj. Gen. George H. ThomasÂ’s army
had reached Nashville. Hood reached the outskirts of Nashville on December
2, occupied positions on a line of hills parallel to those of the Union
and began erecting fieldworks. Union Army Engineer, Brig. Gen. James St.
Clair Morton, had overseen the construction of sophisticated fortifications
at Nashville in 1862-63, strengthened by others, which would soon see use.
From the 1st through the 14th, Thomas made preparations for the Battle
of Nashville in which he intended to destroy HoodÂ’s army. On the night
of December 14, Thomas informed Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, acting as Maj.
Gen. Ulysses S. GrantÂ’s chief of staff, that he would attack the next day.
Thomas planned to strike both of HoodÂ’s flanks. Before daylight on the
15th, the first of the Union troops, led by Maj. Gen. James Steedman, set
out to hit the Confederate right. The attack was made and the Union forces
held down one Rebel corps there for the rest of the day. Attack on the
Confederate left did not begin until after noon when a charge commenced
on Montgomery Hill. With this classic chargeÂ’s success, attacks on other
parts of the Confederate left commenced, all eventually successful. By
this time it was dark and fighting stopped for the day. Although battered
and with a much smaller battle line, Gen. Hood was still confident. He
established a main line of resistance along the base of a ridge about two
miles south of the former location, throwing up new works and fortifying
ShyÂ’s and OvertonÂ’s hills on their flanks. The IV Army Corps marched out
to within 250 yards, in some places, of the ConfederateÂ’s new line and
began constructing fieldworks. During the rest of the morning, other Union
troops moved out toward the new Confederate line and took up positions
opposite it. The Union attack began against HoodÂ’s strong right flank on
OvertonÂ’s Hill. The same brigade that had taken Montgomery Hill the day
before received the nod for the charge up OvertonÂ’s Hill. This charge,
although gallantly conducted, failed, but other troops (Maj. Gen. A.J.
SmithÂ’sÂ  Â“IsraelitesÂ” ) successfully assaulted ShyÂ’s Hill in their
fronts. Seeing the success along the line, other Union troops charged up
OvertonÂ’s Hill and took it. HoodÂ’s army fled. Thomas had left one escape
route open but the Union army set off in pursuit. For ten days, the pursuit
continued until the beaten and battered Army of Tennessee recrossed the
Tennessee River. HoodÂ’s army was stalled at Columbia, beaten at Franklin,
and routed at Nashville. Hood retreated to Tupelo and resigned his command.

","  As Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford ForrestÂ’s expedition into
West Tennessee neared its conclusion, Union Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan,
with the brigades of Col. Cyrus L. Dunham and Col. John W. Fuller, attempted
to cut Forrest off from withdrawing across the Tennessee River.Â  DunhamÂ’s
and ForrestÂ’s march routes, on December 31, 1862, brought them into contact
at ParkerÂ’s Cross Roads. Skirmishing began about 9:00 am, with Forrest
taking an initial position along a wooded ridge northwest of Dunham at
the intersection. Confederate artillery gained an early advantage. Dunham
pulled his brigade back a half mile and redeployed, facing north.Â 
His Federals repelled frontal feints until attacked on both flanks and
rear by ForrestÂ’s mounted and dismounted troops. During a lull, Forrest
sent Dunham a demand for an unconditional surrender. Dunham refused and
was preparing for ForrestÂ’s next onset when FullerÂ’s Union brigade arrived
from the north and surprised the Confederates with an attack on their rear;
Confederate security detachments had failed to warn of FullerÂ’s approach.
Â“Charge Â’em both ways,Â” ordered Forrest. The Confederates briefly reversed
front, repelled Fuller, then rushed past DunhamÂ’s demoralized force and
withdrew south to Lexington and then across the Tennessee River. Both sides
claimed victory, but the Confederate claims appear to have more credence.

"," TN003

"," April 6-7, 1862

"," As a result of the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson, Confederate
Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, the commander in the area, was forced to fall
back, giving up Kentucky and much of West and Middle Tennessee. He chose
Corinth, Mississippi, a major transportation center, as the staging area
for an offensive against Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the
Tennessee before the Army of the Ohio, under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell,
could join it. The Confederate retrenchment was a surprise, although a
pleasant one, to the Union forces, and it took Grant, with about 40,000
men, some time to mount a southern offensive, along the Tennessee River,
toward Pittsburg Landing. Grant received orders to await Buell’s Army of
the Ohio at Pittsburg Landing. Grant did not choose to fortify his position;
rather, he set about drilling his men many of which were raw recruits.
Johnston originally planned to attack Grant on April 4, but delays postponed
it until the 6th. Attacking the Union troops on the morning of the 6th,
the Confederates surprised them, routing many. Some Federals made determined
stands and by afternoon, they had established a battle line at the sunken
road, known as the Â“Hornets Nest.Â” Repeated Rebel attacks failed to carry
the Hornets Nest, but massed artillery helped to turn the tide as Confederates
surrounded the Union troops and captured, killed, or wounded most.Â 
Johnston had been mortally wounded earlier and his second in command, Gen.
P.G.T. Beauregard, took over. The Union troops established another line
covering Pittsburg Landing, anchored with artillery and augmented by BuellÂ’s
men who began to arrive and take up positions. Fighting continued until
after dark, but the FederalsÂ  held. By the next morning, the combined
Federal forces numbered about 40,000, outnumbering BeauregardÂ’s army of
less than 30,000. Beauregard was unaware of the arrival of BuellÂ’s army
and launched a counterattack in response to a two-mile advance by William
NelsonÂ’s division of BuellÂ’s army at 6:00 am, which was, at first, successful.
Union troops stiffened and began forcing the Confederates back. Beauregard
ordered a counterattack, which stopped the Union advance but did not break
its battle line. At this point, Beauregard realized that he could not win
and, having suffered too many casualties, he retired from the field and
headed back to Corinth. On the 8th, Grant sent Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman,
with two brigades, and Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, with his division, in
pursuit of Beauregard. They ran into the Rebel rearguard, commanded by
Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest, at Fallen Timbers. ForrestÂ’s aggressive tactics,
although eventually contained, influenced the Union troops to return to
Pittsburg Landing. GrantÂ’s mastery of the Confederate forces continued;
he had beaten them once again. The Confederates continued to fall back
until launching their mid-August offensive.

On the night of November 28, 1864, Gen. John Bell Hood’s Army of Tennessee

Union armyÂ’s life line. Cavalry skirmishing between Brig. Gen. James H.

the crossroads at Spring Hill. In late afternoon, the Federals repulsed
a piecemeal Confederate infantry attack. During the night, the rest of
SchofieldÂ’s command passed from Columbia through Spring Hill to Franklin.
This was, perhaps, HoodÂ’s best chance to isolate and defeat the Union army.

reorganized, and were redesignated as the Army of Tennessee. They then
advanced to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and prepared to go into winter quarters.Â 
Maj. Gen. William S. RosecransÂ’s Union Army of the Cumberland followed
Bragg from Kentucky to Nashville. Rosecrans left Nashville on December
26, with about 44,000 men, to defeat BraggÂ’s army of more than 37,000.Â 
He found BraggÂ’s army on December 29 and went into camp that night, within
hearing distance of the Rebels. At dawn on the 31st, BraggÂ’s men attacked
the Union right flank. The Confederates had driven the Union line back
to the Nashville Pike by 10:00 am but there it held. Union reinforcements
arrived from RosecransÂ’s left in the late forenoon to bolster the stand,
and before fighting stopped that day the Federals had established a new,
strong line. On New Years Day, both armies marked time. Bragg surmised
that Rosecrans would now withdraw, but the next morning he was still in
position. In late afternoon, Bragg hurled a division at a Union division
that, on January 1, had crossed Stones River and had taken up a strong
position on the bluff east of the river. The Confederates drove most of
the Federals back across McFaddenÂ’s Ford, but with the assistance of artillery,
the Federals repulsed the attack, compelling the Rebels to retire to their
original position. Bragg left the field on the January 4-5, retreating
to Shelbyville and Tullahoma, Tennessee. Rosecrans did not pursue, but
as the Confederates retired, he claimed the victory. Stones River boosted
Union morale.Â  The Confederates had been thrown back in the east,

"," In an effort to relieve Union forces besieged in Chattanooga,
Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas and Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant initiated the

opening of the road to Chattanooga from BrownÂ’s Ferry on the Tennessee

At 3:00 am, on October 27, portions of HazenÂ’s brigade embarked upon pontoons

"," October 4, 1862

"," The U.S. Navy began a blockade of Galveston Harbor in July

1861, but the town remained in Confederate hands for the next 14 months.

At 6:00 am on October 4, 1862, Cdr. W.B. Renshaw, commanding the blockading

ships in the Galveston Bay area, sent Harriet Lane into the harbor, flying

a flag of truce. The intention was to inform the military authorities in

Galveston that if the town did not surrender, the U.S. Navy ships would

attack; a one-hour reply would be demanded. Col. Joseph J. Cook, Confederate

military commander in the area, would not come out to the Union ship or

send an officer to receive the communication, so Harriet Lane weighed anchor

and returned to the fleet. Four Union steamers, with a mortar boat in tow,

entered the harbor and moved to the same area where Harriet Lane had anchored.Â 

Observing this activity, Confederates at Fort Point fired one or more shots

and the U.S. Navy ships answered. Eventually, the Union ships disabled

the one Confederate gun at Fort Point and fired at other targets. Two Rebel

guns from another location opened on the Union ships. The boat that Col.

Cook had dispatched now approached the Union vessels and two Confederate

officers boarded U.S.S. Westfield. Renshaw demanded an unconditional surrender

of Galveston or he would begin shelling. Cook refused Renshaw’s terms,

and conveyed to Renshaw that upon him rested the responsibility of destroying

the town and killing women, children, and aliens. Renshaw threatened to

resume the shelling and made preparations for towing the mortar boat into

position.Â  One of the Confederate officers then asked if he could

be granted time to talk with Col. Cook again. This officer, a major, negotiated

with Renshaw for a four-day truce to evacuate the women, children, and

aliens from the city. Cook approved the truce but added a stipulation that

if Renshaw would not move troops closer to Galveston, Cook would not permit

his men to come below the city.Â  The agreement was finalized but never

written down, which later caused problems. The Confederates did evacuate,

taking all of their weapons, ammunition, supplies, and whatever they could

carry with them. Renshaw did not think that the agreement allowed for all

this but, in the end, did nothing, due to the lack of a written document.

The fall of Galveston meant that one more important Confederate port was

closed to commerce. But the port of Galveston was not shut down for long.

"," May 12-13, 1865

"," Since March 1865, a gentlemanÂ’s agreement precluded fighting

between Union and Confederate forces on the Rio Grande. In spite of this

agreement, Col. Theodore H. Barrett, commanding forces at Brazos Santiago,

Texas, dispatched an expedition, composed of 250 men of the 62nd U.S. Colored

Infantry Regiment and 50 men of the 2nd Texas Cavalry Regiment under the

command of Lt. Col. David Branson, to the mainland, on May 11, 1865, to

attack reported Rebel outposts and camps. Prohibited by foul weather from

crossing to Point Isabel as instructed, the expedition crossed to Boca

Chica much later. At 2:00 am, on May 12, the expeditionary force surrounded

the Rebel outpost at WhiteÂ’s Ranch, but found no one there. Exhausted,

having been up most of the night, Branson secreted his command in a thicket

and among weeds on the banks of the Rio Grande and allowed his men to sleep.

Around 8:30 am, people on the Mexican side of the river informed the Rebels

of the FederalsÂ’ whereabouts. Branson promptly led his men off to attack

a Confederate camp at Palmito Ranch. After much skirmishing along the way,

the Federals attacked the camp and scattered the Confederates. Branson

and his men remained at the site to feed themselves and their horses but,

at 3:00 pm, a sizable Confederate force appeared, influencing the Federals

to retire to WhiteÂ’s Ranch. He sent word of his predicament to Barrett,

who reinforced Branson at daybreak, on the 13th, with 200 men of the 34th

Indiana Volunteer Infantry. The augmented force, now commanded by Barrett,

started out towards Palmito Ranch, skirmishing most of the way. At Palmito

Ranch, they destroyed the rest of the supplies not torched the day before

and continued on. A few miles forward, they became involved in a sharp

firefight. After the fighting stopped, Barrett led his force back to a

bluff at Tulosa on the river where the men could prepare dinner and camp

for the night. At 4:00 pm, a large Confederate cavalry force, commanded

by Col. John S. Â“RipÂ” Ford, approached, and the Federals formed a battle

line. The Rebels hammered the Union line with artillery. To preclude an

enemy flanking movement, Barrett ordered a retreat. The retreat was orderly

and skirmishers held the Rebels at a respectable distance. Returning to

Boca Chica at 8:00 pm, the men embarked at 4:00 am, on the 14th. This was

the last battle in the Civil War. Native, African, and Hispanic Americans

were all involved in the fighting. Many combatants reported that firing

came from the Mexican shore and that some Imperial Mexican forces crossed

the Rio Grande but did not take part in the battle. These reports are unproven.

Sabine Pass. The next morning, the two schooners crossed the bar, took

position, and began firing on the Confederate shore battery. The shots

from both land and shore fell far short of the targets. The ships then

25th, the schooners moved up to the battery and destroyed it while Acting

Master Frederick Crocker, commander of the expedition, received the surrender

","  About 6:00 am on the morning of September 8, 1863, a Union

flotilla of four gunboats and seven troop transports steamed into Sabine

Pass and up the Sabine River with the intention of reducing Fort Griffin

and landing troops to begin occupying Texas. As the gunboats approached

Fort Griffin, they came under accurate fire from six cannons. The Confederate

gunners at Fort Griffin had been sent there as a punishment. To break the

day-to-day monotony, the gunners practiced firing artillery at range markers

placed in the river. Their practice paid off. Fort Griffin’s small force

of 44 men, under command of Lt. Richard W. Dowling, forced the Union flotilla

to retire and captured the gunboat Clifton and about 200 prisoners. Further

Union operations in the area ceased for about a month. The heroics at Fort

the Rappahannock and Rapidan Rivers above Fredericksburg. Passing the Rapidan
via Germanna and Ely’s Fords, the Federals concentrated near Chancellorsville
on April 30 and May 1. The III Corps was ordered to join the army via United
States Ford. SedgwickÂ’s VI Corps and GibbonÂ’s division remained to demonstrate
against the Confederates at Fredericksburg. In the meantime, Lee left a
covering force under Maj. Gen. Jubal Early in Fredericksburg and marched
with the rest of the army to confront the Federals. As HookerÂ’s army moved
toward Fredericksburg on the Orange Turnpike, they encountered increasing
Confederate resistance. Hearing reports of overwhelming Confederate force,
Hooker ordered his army to suspend the advance and to concentrate again
at Chancellorsville. Pressed closely by LeeÂ’s advance, Hooker adopted a
defensive posture, thus giving Lee the initiative.Â  On the morning
of May 2, Lt. Gen. T.J. Jackson directed his corps on a march against the
Federal left flank, which was reported to beÂ  Â“hanging in the air.Â”
Fighting was sporadic on other portions of the field throughout the day,
as JacksonÂ’s column reached its jump-off point. At 5:20 pm, JacksonÂ’s line
surged forward in an overwhelming attack that crushed the Union XI Corps.
Federal troops rallied, resisted the advance, and counterattacked. Disorganization
on both sides and darkness ended the fighting. While making a night reconnaissance,
Jackson was mortally wounded by his own men and carried from the field.
J.E.B. Stuart took temporary command of JacksonÂ’s Corps. On May 3, the
Confederates attacked with both wings of the army and massed their artillery
at Hazel Grove. This finally broke the Federal line at Chancellorsville.
Hooker withdrew a mile and entrenched in a defensive Â“UÂ” with his back
to the river at United States Ford. Union generals Berry and Whipple and
Confederate general Paxton were killed; StonewallÂ  Jackson was mortally
wounded. On the night of May 5-6, after Union reverses at Salem Church,
Hooker recrossed to the north bank of the Rappahannock. This battle was

"," March 2, 1864

"," On February 28, Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick left his encampment
at Stevensburg with 4,000 picked men to raid Richmond. Col. Ulric Dahlgren,
son of Rear Adm. John Dahlgren, commanded an advance force of 500 men.
While the main body under Kilpatrick rode along the Virginia Central Railroad
tearing up track, Dahlgren rode south to the James River, hoping to cross
over, penetrate Richmond’s defenses from the rear, and release Union prisoners
at Belle Isle. Kilpatrick reached the outskirts of Richmond on March 1
and skirmished before the cityÂ’s defenses, waiting for Dahlgren to rejoin
the main column. Dahlgren, however, was delayed, and Kilpatrick was forced
to withdraw with Confederate cavalry in pursuit. Hampton attacked Kilpatrick
near Old Church on the 2nd, but the Federals found refuge with elements
of ButlerÂ’s command at New Kent Court House. In the meantime, DahlgrenÂ’s
men, unable to penetrate RichmondÂ’s defenses, tried to escape pursuit by
riding north of the city. DahlgrenÂ’s command became separated, and on March
2 his detachment of about 100 men was ambushed by a detachment of the 9th
Virginia Cavalry and Home Guards in King and Queen County near Walkerton.
Dahlgren was killed and most of his men captured. Papers found on DahlgrenÂ’s
body that ordered him to burn Richmond and assassinate President Jefferson
Davis and his cabinet caused a political furor. Southerners accused the
North of initiating Â“a war of extermination.Â” Meade, Kilpatrick, and Lincoln
all disavowed any knowledge of the Dahlgren Papers.

Brig. Gen. Edward Johnson pulled back to Westview, six miles west of Staunton.

Union soldiers of Brig. Gen. Jacob D. CoxÂ’s District of Kanawha threatened

the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad. The Federals by mid-May, although

ousted from Pearisburg, held Mercer County and braced for a lunge at the

railroad. Confederate Brig. Gen. Humphery Marshall arrived from Abingdon,

Virginia, with the Army of East Kentucky. Boldly seizing the initiative,

Marshall bested CoxÂ’s two brigades during three days of fighting, May 15-17,

in Mercer County centering on Princeton Courthouse. Breaking contact with

the Confederates on the night of the 17-18, Cox withdrew 20 miles to Camp

Flat Top. Col. George Crook, commanding CoxÂ’s 3rd brigade, marched via

the James and Kanawha Turnpike and occupied Lewisburg, where on May 23

he defeated Brig. Gen. Henry HethÂ’s brigade. Upon learning that Maj. Gen.

Thomas J. Â“StonewallÂ” JacksonÂ’s army had routed Maj. Gen. N.P. BanksÂ’ division

at Winchester (March 25) and driven it across the Potomac, Crook evacuated

Lewisburg and pulled back to Meadow Bluff.

"," July 11, 1861

","Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan assumed command of Union

forces in western Virginia in June 1861. On June 27, he moved his divisions

from Clarksburg south against Lt. Col. John Pegram’s Confederates, reaching

the vicinity of Rich Mountain on July 9. Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. T.A. MorrisÂ’s

Union brigade marched from Philippi to confront Brig. Gen. R.S. GarnettÂ’s

command at Laurel Hill. On July 11, Brig. Gen. William S. Rosecrans led

a reinforced brigade by a mountain path to seize the Staunton-Parkersburg

Turnpike in PegramÂ’s rear. A sharp two-hour fight ensued in which the Confederates

were split in two. Half escaped to Beverly, but Pegram and the others surrendered

on July 13.Â  Hearing of PegramÂ’s defeat, Garnett abandoned Laurel

Hill. The Federals pursued, and, during fighting at CorrickÂ’s Ford on July

13, Garnett was killed. On July 22, McClellan was ordered to Washington,

and Rosecrans assumed command of Union forces in western Virginia. Union

victory at Rich Mountain was instrumental in propelling McClellan to command

of the Army of the Potomac.

"," On September 19, a detachment of PorterÂ’s V Corps pushed

across the river at BotelerÂ’s Ford, attacked the Confederate rearguard

commanded by Brig. Gen. William Pendleton, and captured four guns. Early

on the 20th, Porter pushed elements of two divisions across the Potomac

to establish a bridgehead. HillÂ’s division counterattacked while many of

the Federals were crossing and nearly annihilated the 118th Pennsylvania

action discouraged Federal pursuit. On November 7, President Lincoln relieved

McClellan of command because of his failure to follow up LeeÂ’s retreating

army. Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside rose to command the Union army.
